## Introduction

The topic for this year is a social network built around painting, tactile
paintings, and its transformation pipelines. Users in our social network want to
post the results of their efforts while using
[Picastlo](https://picastlo.github.io), an [open-source
tool](https://github.com/picastlo/picastlo.github.io) to make tactile paintings. 

The functionalities involved include managing users and user authentication,
reading posts according to their visibility (groups/friends), make new posts
that text, and images, create, use, and share Picastlo pipelines. You will have
to analyse and modify the code in the prototype available that is designed as a
standalone client application. Namely, you will need to start by understanding
what is a pipeline and how to represent it on a database.

The actors in this systems are unauthenticated users and regular registered
Picastlo Users. Unauthenticated users can use Picastlo GUI and see posts,
download images and load pipelines in Picastlo GUI that are classified as
public.  

A user of the system can add a post in the social network, adding a picture and
a link to a pipeline stored in their profile. A processing pipeline is a
sequence of transformation as used in the shared prototype. A user can then see
a sequence of posts in a timeline that were posted publicly, directly by their
friends or by the members of groups that they belong to. Any user can then load
a pipeline, theirs or of another user, that (optionally includes the initial
image) into Picastlo, change the pipeline, and download the result to print in a
3D printer. In the end, The user may store the pipeline in their own profile,
customizing the visibility parameters (public, private, or friends only). A user
needs to sign in to the system in order to see the timeline, and profile.

The operations that you must implement thoroughly need to support a client
application where it is possible to follow the workflow above. All other
operations and the data necessary can be mocked or introduced via seed data.
User registration can be mocked via seed data. 

**Data resources needed to make the application work do not need to be fully managed by the API and can be
introduced in the database using seed data creation procedures.**


## Technical Details

### Application Architecture

The application should be structured in microservices and each microservice
should implement a layered architecture and make available a REST API. The
microservices should be accessible through an API Gateway that implements the
full social network to present it to a client application. The application
should allow the uploading of images and pipelines and storing then in
databases.  

### Picastlo GUI

The code provided as open-source includes a GUI that processes images with
simple image transformations to produce tactile paintings. You should fork that
repository and use that code, or just copy the code, to implement your GUI for the social network.

### Requirements

#### Server-side system

The application should be implemented using the Spring framework and Kotlin. The
API should be documented using OpenAPI 3.0. The application should be developed
in a layered architecture with a  database in memory (H2). All the data
necessary to run the application should be preloaded into the database.

- Server applications should be SpringBoot, use Spring Data to connect to
  databases, and use H2 in memory database
- OpenAPI live documentation should identify resources and sub-resources clearly to support the full life-cycle of the resources.
- You should implement distributed model-based access control based on JWT tokens and capabilities.
- You need to store pictures in blobs in the database.
- Server-side application should be implemented using microservices.

#### Client application

Your client-side single-page (web) application should implement a hierarchical
structure of components directly mapping a specification developed using IFML
and implementing the following user-stories. 

The application should be implemented using the React/Redux framework and
TypeScript. The client application should work together with the server-side
application to provide a full user experience. The connection to the server-side
application should be done using the OpenAPI specification. 

The UI should use a mainstream component library to achieve a professional look.

#### User-stories to complete

1. As an unregistered user, I want to access the picastlo social network homepage to see the first page of the public timeline of the system.
2. As an unregistered user, I want to access the picastlo social network homepage to see a page of the public timeline of the system to see another page of public timeline of the system (next, previous, any number in between).
